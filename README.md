### Exercise 1
Create a parent component with a label. Create an array ```const rawData = [1,-5,1,2,44,3,4,5,5,5,5,6,7]``` in the parent component. Pass the array to a child component called `MinMaxComponent` that displays a label `Min/Max`. Inside of the `MinMaxComponent` component, *manually* find the maximum and minimum number in the array and send the results back to the parent component and display the min and max values returned from the child component.
